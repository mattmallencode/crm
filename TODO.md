THE TEAM'S PROCESS 
Our team's process for completing tasks was highly organized and effective, despite being a small team. With daily three-hour work sessions, we ensured that we were all working together and making progress on the project at hand. This approach helped our team stay on track and remain focused on important tasks.

In addition, our team had a weekly whiteboarding session where we planned user stories. This collaborative approach to task management ensures that everyone was aligned on the project's goals and objectives. By breaking down tasks into user stories, our team prioritized work and ensured that we were working on the most critical tasks.

Our team's approach also included a "polishing" week every second week. This was an excellent practice as it allowed our team to review completed work and make necessary improvements. This approach helped to ensure that the final product was of a high quality.

Overall, our team's process was highly effective, and our approach to task management was highly structured, ensuring that everyone was working together towards a common goal. This collaborative approach allowed our team to remain focused and prioritize work, resulting in high-quality work that was completed efficiently.
