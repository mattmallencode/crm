Oliver continued with testing for week three. The main issues that arised happened when testing pages that required a login. pytest-asyncio is going to be implemented in the future which should allow for testing connections and modules that require a login. Besided the login problems the rest of the pages worked well.

Matt and eimantas developed extra features throughout the week. These features included contact results being implemented over multiple pages, narrowing down the view of contats, a logout, view team feature, sorting and searching on the contacts page and team required decorator. Matt also integrated gmail using oAuth and emimants done some debugging.

Aria continued with the css finishing the login and sign up pages and worked on the contacts page. He also worked on the report.
