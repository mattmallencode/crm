For week two Eimantas worked on the Contacts features for the project. He managed to get the data from the database and displayed it on screen as a table. This allowed for companies to manage their business contacts, edit their contacts, delete these contacts and add more contacts. Finally he tweaked the create team feature to create your own organisation.

Matt made code for user authentication. He also modified the data models code so it now uses instance variables. Furthermore The login endpoint was altered so now users can accept email invites.

Oliver created the forms for this week. He then worked on testing for the project making sure everything was behaving the way it was intended to.

Aria continued working on the projects css. This mainly entailed fixing up the look of any of the new features such as the forms. He also wrote the team report.
