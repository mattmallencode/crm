We started the project on Wednesday the 18th of January. We began by pitching ideas for the project. We settled on creating a CRM thought of by Matt. From here we started to set goals for our project. We wanted a user to be able to create an account/login, have the capability of creating an organisation, be able to then invite users to this organisation and finally have users be able to join these organisations. From here we began to organise ourselves. This included our github(everyone), AWS(Matt), google docs (aria), trello(aria). Matt help us with understanding the basics of git(push,merge,ect..)

On the Thursday the 19th virtual environments were set up for everyone. Oliver created a Gmail account for the projects CRM. Aria worked on the login and signup html and created a company logo for the CRM. Eimantas worked on a system that was able to invite people by email to a organisation on the site. The main issue Eimantas had was he wasnt able to send emails. He discovered the following day that turning on 2FA fixs this issue. Matt also got the AWS working on this day. He discovered that Eduroam was blocking queries sent to the AWS. 

On Friday Aria set up the css for some of the html he was working on and typed the report. Oliver started to implement Flask WTForms and contiunes to work on them. Matt is currently working on user authentication and Eimantas is finishing up on the invite system.
