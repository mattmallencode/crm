week 4
This week I was put onto testing.  I created a test to make sure that a team has been created. I am currently working on creating a test to make sure that a contact has been added to the database. I also discovered how to store session cookies which helped fix some of Olivers previous tests. 

week 5
This week I worked on the CSS. The main things I worked on was the Contacts, Login and Sign Up pages. The main problem for this week is that multiple icons that I want next to certain links are fixed to a point on the screen and are unable to move. I have also fixed all the buttons as they didn't work properly after some slight changes were made I presume. The signup and login page also needed little tweaks here and there such as updated background ect and the design of the unfilled submitted form was overlooked so that had to be looked at

week 6
This week i was working on new features for our flask application. I worked specifically on the deals page trying to get a search bar and the deals sorting function working. I found this part of the project a bit difficult as I am not the strongest coder in the group but with help from Eimantas, Oliver and Matt I managed to get a good portion of the work done. Next week I will be working on writing the report

week 7
This week I worked on finishing off on how the deals page functioned. This included finishing the search bar feature and finishing the sorting features of the deals page. I have also started working on the css as it need to be polished up a bit for our final product.

next week I will continue on tying up the applications loose ends
