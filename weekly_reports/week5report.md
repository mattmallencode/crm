This week Aria worked on the css and wrote the week five report. He mainly looked after the websites css and fixed a few problems that the code had. The main errors that he had to deal with were the sign up pages empty form submissions, login page, and contacts page.

Matt worked with the websites Turbo this week. There was a bug that was effecting the rendering as it was running on every page. However, Matt fixed it. Matt has also integrated a google calender so users can now schedule meetings with contacts generating a Google Meet link automatically for the meeting.

Oliver fixed buttons on the contacts page using Turbo Flask in the base.html. Oliver also implemented turbo in a way so only the contacts were updated rather then the entire page. Matt also helped Oliver getting turbo working as he has had some experience with it before.

Eimantas helped with the css this week also, using the css grid display and added a few other features such as arrows that pointed to the next page. He was sick this week so through no fault of his own was he able to work to his full potential.
